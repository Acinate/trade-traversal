# Trade Traversal

Trade traversal is a tool that helps traders keep track of their trades. Our community takes an approach called **risk reversal**. This approach emphasizes the use of financing debit trades with credit, ultimately creating trades that have little to no risk, while maintaining the high reward.

For example, a user purchases the following option: 

* BOT 5 MSFT 8/21 215/220 Vertical Call @ $0.80. 

He also opens the following trades to **finance** this trade to reduce the initial debit.

* SLD 5 MSFT 8/14 217.5/220 Vertical Call @ $0.45.
* SLD 5 MSFT 8/14 202.5/200 Vertical Put @ $0.55.

Initially our trader paid a debit of $4.00 for his trade. Now that he has sold shorter term options against this position he was able to collect $5.00. Our trader now has a long position on MSFT not only for free, but for a total credit of $100 profit. He still maintains his upside gain of $2100 if MSFT closes above 215 after 8/21.
